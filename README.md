# CPI program with the following flow: 

## 1. Function A as the swap function for Raydium DEX
## 2. Function B as the swap function for Whirlpools DEX
## 3. Function C as the function to add/remove whitelist addresses that can access all functions in this program. After that, I also need JS code to interact with it off-chain.
